# OFLovesenseConnector
Connects a Lovense toy to an OF newsfeed post. This will cause any associated toys to react to comments and likes on a post in real time.

## Installation
1. Download and install 'Python 3.9' or later (https://www.python.org/downloads/). You may alredy have this on your machine.
2. Clone the repo, or download the raw `of_post_lovense_connector.py` python script.

## Usage
1. Once Python has been installed, double click on the script and select Python 3.9 or later to launch it.
2. In the new command window, follow the instructions the script provides.
    1. Place the Lovesense Remote app in 'Game Mode'
    2. Collect the IP addres and SSL Port # from the app
    3. Verify the toy has connected (3 second vibration)
    4. Collect the post link from OF (choose the share icon to copy the link to your keyboard).
    5. Wait :). With each new comment and like (after processing all existing comments and likes -- see the script to disable that initial step), your toy will be reactive (in addition to a default vibration).
